Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
Bountibot is a new tool for aligning developers' incentives with a github's project's, and onboarding them into the ethereum ecosystem. Users interact with it via automatic github comments, which encourage them to post an ethereum address so that they will be paid with LINK token when their PR is merged. They can see all their activity at the website https://bountibot-staging.appspot.com/
